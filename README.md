# 👋 Hi, I'm **RebooterX**

**Dev & Self-Hosting Enthusiast based in Bavaria, Germany**  
I enjoy crafting infrastructure that runs smoothly, silently – and better than yesterday.

---

## 🧰 What I do

- 🔧 Automating infrastructure with **Docker**, **Proxmox**, **Ansible**
- 🕹️ Building small tools & self-hosted systems for fun and function
- 🧠 Experimenting with network layers – including the infamous **Layer 8**
- 🧰 Documenting setups that actually work™ (for future me and others)
- 💡 Passionate about solid architecture, reproducibility & open source

---

## 🚀 Projects in the making

- `infraforge` → a curated toolkit for smart self-hosting & system automation  
- `proxmox-lab` → clean VM/LXC environments for labs and client setups  
- `dotfiles` → terminal things, CLI tools and aliases that make life easier
